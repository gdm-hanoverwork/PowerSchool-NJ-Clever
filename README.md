# PowerSchool-NJ-Clever

I've parked all files in the folder: Clever PowerQuery Support in order for a direct .zip download to be usable as a plugin as directly as possible.

I'll update these files if they're not passing Clever's upload muster.

# Update ( September 16, 2022 )

I've updated my files a little bit, and there's one more minor tweak I think I need to do to the "Teachers" export...

Also note the caveat that my files are pulling for New Jersey, so your state implementation will differ!
