# PowerSchool-NJ-Clever

I've parked all files in the folder: Clever PowerQuery Support in order for a direct .zip download to be usable as a plugin as directly as possible.

I'll update these files if they're not passing Clever's upload muster.

# Update ( September 16, 2022 )

I've updated my files a little bit, and there's one more minor tweak I think I need to do to the "Teachers" export...

Also note the caveat that my files are pulling for New Jersey, so your state implementation will differ!

# Available on PowerSource (October 5, 2022):
(a.k.a. the Self-Promotion section)

I've also got a "plugin" for PowerSchool that might be useful if you're using PowerSchool, allowing you to upload the Clever badges into PowerSchool, and reveal (or not) the badges to Administration, Teachers or Parents.

# Update ( October 10, 2022 ) 
I've fixed both the Teachers Export (Teachers now will only export for their "home school"), and Sections (Sections will not extract if students have not ever been enrolled in the sections).
